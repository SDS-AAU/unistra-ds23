You are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated. class denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither

1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)
Create a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling alternatively simply PCA or SVD) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix.</description></item><item><title>Intermediate Network Analysis</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/01_networks/2_networks_intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/01_networks/2_networks_intermediate/</guid><description> Use the tabs to access content.

That includes e.g. semantic networks, semantic search, recommender systems.
To follow the case, please get an account at https://www.kaggle.com/
We will be working with developing a Job Recommendation System based on different vectorisation and semantic search techniques.

We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.

We will:
generate embedding representations for academic abstracts and patent text we will identify topics within scientific literature using UMAP and HDBSCAN generate search strings based on extracted keywords (cTF-IDF) search patent documents and identify related technologies (Using Annoy) Data for the project Download
