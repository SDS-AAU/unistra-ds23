Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/tree/master/00_data/network_krackhard (Hint: You neet to download the raw data) Data: What do I get? Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks. Time to give it a shot as well. Krackhardt D. (1987). Cognitive social structures. Social Networks, 9, 104-134. The company manufactured high-tech equipment on the west coast of the United States and had just over 100 employees with 21 managers. Each manager was asked to whom do you go to for advice and who is your friend, to whom do you report was taken from company documents. Description\nThe dataset includes 4 files - 3xKrack-High-Tec and 1x High-Tec-Attributes. Krack-High-Tec includes the following three 21x3 text matrices:\nADVICE, directed, binary FRIENDSHIP, directed, binary REPORTS_TO, directed, binary Column 1 contains the ID of the ego (from where the edge starts), and column 2 the alter (to which the edge goes). Column 3 indicates the presence (=1) or absence (=0) of an edge.\nHigh-Tec-Attributes includes one 21x4 valued matrix.\nID: Numeric ID of the manager AGE: The managers age (in years) TENURE: The length of service or tenure (in years) LEVEL: The level in the corporate hierarchy (coded 1,2 and 3; 1 = CEO, 2 = Vice President, 3 = manager) DEPT: The department (coded 1,2,3,4 with the CEO in department 0, ie not in a department) Tasks 1. Create a network Generate network objects for the companies organizational structure (reports to), friendship, advice This networks are generated from the corresponding edgelists Also attach node characteristics from the corresponding nodelist 2. Analysis Make a little analysis on:\nA: Network level characteristics. Find the overal network level of:\nDensity Transistivity (Clustering Coefficient) Reciprocity \u0026hellip; for the different networks. Describe and interpret the results. Answer the following questions:\nAre relationships like friendship and advice giving usually reciprocal? Are friends of your friends also your friends? Are the employees generally more likely to be in a friendship or advice-seeking relationship? B: Node level characteristics: Likewise, find out:\nWho is most popular in the networks. Who is the most wanted friend, and advice giver? Are managers in higher hirarchy more popular as friend, and advice giver? C: Relational Characteristics: Answer the following questions:\nAre managers from the same 1. department, or on the same 2. hirarchy, 3. age, or 4. tenuere more likely to become friends or give advice? (hint: assortiativity related) Are friends more likely to give each others advice? 3. Visualization Everything goes. Show us some pretty and informative plots. Choose what to plot, and how, on your own. Interpret the results and share some insights.\nDanish Power Elites Many people dream of being one of them, but only few make it all the way to the top. According to two CBS researchers, it takes more than just hard work to get to the top of the Danish hierarchy of power. read more\nIn this project we are going to construct and explore a network of Danish power elites derived from boards of various organisations in th country. We will construct an association network: Who is being in the same board? And first explore \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; centrality indicators. Then identify communities and central persons within those. Finally we look at some \u0026ldquo;fancier\u0026rdquo; interactive network visualisation.\nContext: The Danish Power Elites Antons PhD Thesis Brief Summary of findings (CBS) Journal Paper in Sociology More to be found with googleling\u0026hellip; Data Github (R Repository) Magteliten website Or, easier\u0026hellip; on our github Tasks Who are the most central persons?

Notebooks Starter EU Start-Ups In this exercise, we will analyze the company-link network of startups listed in the European AI Landscape. In a collaboration with istari.ai, we scraped links from all of their webpages, resulting in a dataset of around 1000 companies. Your task is to identify the key players in AI in Europe that extend beyond the initial list.\nNotebooks Starter EU AI companies starter "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/unistra-ds23/00_exercises/","title":"Exercises","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Here you will find all the assignments for this module.\n"},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/unistra-ds23/info/","title":"Info, Schedule &amp; Co","tags":[],"description":"","content":"General info about the course.\nContent and voluntary exercises will be updated throughout the course, so check for updates.\nAll content will be provided in the following format:\nTheoretical part Application (in both R and Python) Notebook of application (with code) "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/unistra-ds23/info/01_infrastructure/","title":"Infrastructure","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Material Datacamp: Get access to all the Datacamp premium content for free to facilitate your data science journey.

His current contextual focus is the dynamics of AI research and industry.\nHis research is featured in leading academic journals such as Research Policy, but also attracted attention and funding from the industry, and lead to price-winning applications. Daniel is actively engaged in initiatives to educate (social science) students and researchers, professionals, and policymakers in understanding, evaluating, and applying modern Data Science and Artificial Intelligence methods for data-driven decision making.\nAs part of the AI:DK project, he coordinates and leads AI proof-of-concept projects within industry. His team also develops enterprise and policy software solutions for IP search and technology mapping.\nRoman Jurowetzki Associate Professor in Innovation Studies and Data Science at Aalborg University. E-mail: roman@business.aau.dk\nI come from a crossdisciplinary social science background. After my master in innovation economics I was rather frustrated by the underutilization of unstructured data in the field of my PhD project. This was until I discovered Natural Language Processing in 2013. I have been utilizing text and other unstructured data ever since in my research. Recently that has beeen research related to mapping and understanding of complex technological ecosystems. Since 2018 together with Daniel Hain, I am coordinating the Social Data Science specialization at AAU, where we train business and social science students in the application of computational methods.\n"},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/unistra-ds23/01_networks/4_network_viz/","title":"Bonus - Network Visualization","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This session introduces to multimodel natwork analysis concepts\nR Application - Ventwork Visualization Follow along HTML Notebook Notebook Colab Notebook Video 1: Node and Edge Visualization Video 2: Graph Layouts "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/unistra-ds23/01_networks/3_networks_2mode/","title":"Network 2-Mode","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Use the tabs to access content.
